===================

Motivation
----------

A lot of materials found on the subject of female characters and their role in video games are done very clumsily or downright biased. They carefully cherry pick evidence to support their own case. We strongly believe that internet discussion on serious topics demands a high standard of argumentation based on actual evidence - not preconceived notions.
