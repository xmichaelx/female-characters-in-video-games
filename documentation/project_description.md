Project description
===================

Motivation
----------

A lot of materials found on the subject of female characters and their role in video games are done very clumsily or downright biased. They carefully cherry pick evidence to support their own case. We strongly believe that internet discussion on serious topics demands a high standard of argumentation based on actual evidence - not preconceived notions.

Goals
-----

We want to determine what is an overall profile of female characters in video games and if/how it differs from female profile present in human population.

Context
-------

> 'There was a fire fight!'

Indeed there was a fire fight so massive and intense that when it swept through the internet it left trial of bad emotions, false accusations, rape threats to name a few. It all started when Zoe Quinn's ex-boyfriend posted some blog posts alleging her of having romantic relationship with Kotaku journalist Nathan Grayson shortly after all hell broke loose.Quinn was quickly accused of getting positive review of her game 'Depression Quest' as a result of that relationship. The only problem with that is that 'there is no spoon', as was explained by  Stephen Totilo Kotaku's editor-in-chief. This didn't stop anyone from sending rape threats, doxxing, insulting and only god knows what else in the name of truth, ethical journalism and such. 

Quinn wasn't the only victim of harassment by internet trolls another such example would be Brianna Wu. Another women that received approximately 1024 bits of hate mail was  Anita Sarkeesian after she posted  video series titled 'Womens as background' that dealt with objectification of women in video games.
