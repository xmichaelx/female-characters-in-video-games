Data source selection
=====================

Introduction
------------

Representative sample of role-playing games needs to be drawn from population of all games. We constrained ourselves to focus only on role-playing games for two reasons:
- their focus on plot and NPC, at least in theory that focus should provide us with wealth of data for describing female profiles
- there are too many games and game genres to reliably take into account in our modest comparison

We're aware that adeventure games also offer a complicated plots. Also nowadays games tend to merge gameplay aspects traditionally belonging to different genres. Far Cry 3 may serve as an example, where role-playing aspects as character development and non-trivial plot are mixed with traditional FPS-style game focusing on weapons and good aim.

As a criterion of selection we will take cRPG games popularity in major game-dedicated websites, which will be evaluated in the first stage. Next we will compare different sources of data about the games themselves.

For our convenience we focus on games available for PC.

Available data sources for individual games
-------------------------------------------

Internet provides us with plethora of data for each game. Fortunately we do not have to buy each video game that will be tested. YouTube is full of videos presenting complete gameplays from beggining to end, often with alternative paths that can be taken by the player.

For an example we can view a complete playthrough for [Witcher 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui9C1pfxj4g)

Especially in the realm of RPG games common are mini-wikipedias gathering info about NPCs and world lore. They're full of info about the chacters often with screenshots and concept arts, which along with text data will be included in final dataset.

As an example we can show wikia for [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_Wiki)


Selected data sources and motivation
------------------------------------

After preliminary analysis we discovered that (as expected) there was a lot of overlap between the rankings (top titles from each ranking as of 19.11.2014 available in [our repo](../data/rpg_game_rankings)). We decided to merge the results and form our top 100 list.
