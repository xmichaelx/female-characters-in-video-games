Data source selection
=====================

Introduction
------------

Representative sample of role-playing games needs to be drawn from population of all games. We constrained ourselves to focus only on role-playing games for two reasons:
- their focus on plot and NPC, at least in theory that focus should provide us with wealth of data for describing female profiles
- there are too many games and game genres to reliably take into account in our modest comparison

We're aware that adeventure games also offer a complicated plots. Also nowadays games tend to merge gameplay aspects traditionally belonging to different genres. Far Cry 3 may serve as an example, where role-playing aspects as character development and non-trivial plot are mixed with traditional FPS-style game focusing on weapons and good aim.

As a criterion of selection we will take cRPG games popularity in major game-dedicated websites, which will be evaluated in the first stage. Next we will compare different sources of data about the games themselves.

For our convenience we focus on games available for PC.
